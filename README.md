# mongoose-boilerplate  
üå∂Ô∏è SPICED Boilerplate for mongoDB Atlas ‚ÜîÔ∏è Mongoose ‚ÜîÔ∏è NextJS (Remember api folder)  
  
Here be files to not waste time on learning too much about the old mongoose.  
  
Important hints:  
  
1) Products becomes products  
  - Mongoose will get that schema name like "Product" and search or create a database collection called "products"
2) Async everywhere
3) API -- do not call in app.js
- this communicates through the BACK END
